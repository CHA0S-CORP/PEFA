Attention,

I am Kash Patel the FBI director.After proper investigations we discovered
that your impending payment that have been withheld by impostors claiming
to be bank officers in Africa, none existing officials of any real bank, UK
winning lottery, Andy Lear of HSBC bank, Coca-Cola winning lottery and
among a list of others is now under our custody with the help of the
cyber-crimes commission (ccc) and the local police force.

Investigations revealed that you have spent a lot on your personal earned
money just to conclude the successful transfer of your funds to your
nominated bank account by obtaining transfer documents as requested by the
impostors, costing you a lot of money but all to no avail the FBI had to
send some financial crime investigators from our head office in new york
field to Africa, UK and Asia in other to carry out proper investigation

The new FBI has giving authority to the international monetary funds (IMF)
to assist the federal ministry of finance and all the organization involved
such as the central bank, zenith bank, and legit lottery organizations to
immediately commence with the compensation of all the beneficiaries
awaiting the successful transfer of their funds with the help of some of
the best internet investigators attached to the FBI, we traced your
information from the internet as one of the beneficiaries awaiting the
successful transfer of funds to your nominated account.

I am pleased to inform you that a meeting was held as regards the best way
to carry out with the compensation exercise for transparency and most
especially to avoid re-occurrence of the delay in transferring your funds
and the high cost of procuring transfer documents and came to a final
conclusion as all head of organizations involved was duly represented.

It was approved to be issued to you as a valid international ATM card
cash-able at any ATM machine designation in the world. The ATM account has
already been credited with your Three million United States dollars.
($3,000 000.00 USD),with a daily limit of withdrawal of five thousand
united states dollars.($5000.00 USD) the ATM card has already been packaged
and approved to be delivered to your doorstep via a courier delivery
