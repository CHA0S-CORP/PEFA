 Attention Sir/Madam

After due vetting and evaluation of your file that was sent to us
Yesterday by the African Government in conjunction with the Ministry of Finance and Central Bank of Africa
This bank has an instruction to see to the immediate release of the sum of (US$25Million) of your claim that has been on hold to be
transferred into your bank Account, We came  to understand from our findings  that you have been going through hard times by paying a lot of
charges to see to the release of your fund which has been the handwork of some miscreant elements in Africa.

We advise that you stop further communications with any correspondence from Africa, or anywhere concerning your funds as you will receive
your fund from this bank if you follow our instructions.

I am sure your representative in Africa or anywhere will advise you to still go ahead with them, which will be at your own risk. Your
(US$25Million) is already in United States under the care of American First Credit Union and will be transfer into your personal account as
as soon as you abide by the laws of this bank which is as follows.
 


Upon the confirmation of this requirement in our office, we will not hesitate to credit your total sum of US$25Million into your personal
account, do  not go through anybody again but through this Trusted Bank if you really want your fund.

However, for the purpose of proper verification of your identity, among other relevant information and release of your overdue payment, it is
